Problem Statement: As part of the development of our small test_flask project, we are required to implement a branch to not deploy the project always in master, but to use a feature branch that allows us to simulate the development environment and add a new test in our app_test.py file to validate a negative sum.

Task 1: Create a new feature branch named feature/tests.

Task 2: Implement a new test in **app_test.py** to validate negative sum.

Task 3: Implement this branch in **main.yml** to run this branch in the pipeline

Task 4: Configure a CI/CD pipeline to build and test the feature/tests branch.

Task 5: Monitor the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the build and tests pass successfully.
